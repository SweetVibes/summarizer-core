We live in an age where, in most countries, a person’s religion and caste are considered while taking decisions. For example, in the Education field, government feels that there is a minority group that doesn’t have access to the same educational facilities as the normal citizens do. As a result, they took a measure which limits their prerequisites to get into distinguished institutions. But, this makes it much harder for normal students to get in the same institute. So, a minority boy, who knows next to nothing compared to a normal, well to do citizen, will get in while the relatively smarter student is rejected. Here, the government only sees - “The Minority needs help”, but they don’t condsider the effect on the majority.


Furthurmore, when a person looks at a sentence , say - “Strong beliefs prevent people from thinking clearly about issues.” , he/she may say “yes” or “no”, based on what they feel is morally correct. Only after they have thought about the topic for a few minutes, they may draw another conclusion. This is because their first decision was solely based on “belief”, but the latter decision was based on “reason”.


In a court room, the general public may think that the accused is wrong. However, this is just based on their belief that - “He has been accused for a reason, so he must be guilty”. This is what anyone would say, just by looking at the situation. But, when a crucial piece of evidence shows itself, proving beyond doubt that the accused is innocent,the public would then look at both sides of the argument.


On the other hand, being a little optimistic doesn’t hurt. We fight for a cause, because we truly believe that it is correct. through optimism,  freedom for an entire race can be obtained. Such was the case for a country like India, the concept of “dowry”, wife forced to pay the husband or brutal punishment, was abolished. It was the peoples’ persistence that pushed though, even going against the then law.
