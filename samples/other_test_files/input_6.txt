Basically, the logic, which may make sense and even lead to a sensible conclusion, is still based on a hunch. For example, the universe was once proclaimed to be made of a medium called "ether". The question of "What really is light?" could be explained and proven almost in its entirety. However, the nature of light layed on the assumption that ether exists. This was later disproved and hence was this theory of light as a wave.


To get the ball rolling, we need something to start with. The idea of the "smallest indivisible particle" called the atom, was merely a hypothesis proposed by John Dalton, and was later proven false. But this paved the way to enhance this theory and nurture the modern understanding of the world around us today.


In some societies, even stating a hypothesis can lead to a social blunder.A few centuries ago, the earch was considered to be the center of the solar system and all celestial bodies revolve around it. This was referred to as the heliocentric theory, and was believe to be true. Nicholos Coppernicous , who proclaimed that the earth and all other celestial bodies revolve around the sun, was shunned because he simply couldnt prove it. Never the less, when Coppernicous wouldnt stand down, he was executed. But strangely enough, years later, the very same thing was proven true, demonstrating that the XX.


The same can be applied to teenagers. For Teenagers between ten and nineteen, its all about image :  "who has the coolest shirt"; "who has the coolest watch". They'ed try to coax their parents into buying it for them, trying to justify it with a poorly constructed arguement that "with a mobile phone with internet connection, i can use google maps to go anywhere i don't know the directions for". 

Although it is true that the world we see around us is how it is now, because of a hunch, but basing logic on a hunch could lead to catastophic results.
